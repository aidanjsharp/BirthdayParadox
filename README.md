Simulates the birthday paradox, x times.

Birthday Paradox

Assume that in a group of 𝑛
people, birthdays are distributed uniformly at random among 365 days in the year (forget leap years for the moment). Obviously as 𝑛 increases, it becomes more 
and more likely that there is a pair of people that share a birthday. At what threshold for the value of 𝑛 does this likelihood exceed 0.5? This is the famous 
birthday paradox because the answer is somewhat counter-intuitive.

In fact, the birthday paradox can be analyzed approximately using Bernoulli variables (sometimes called indicator random variables): these are very simple variables that take on

- value 1 with probability 𝑝 (for some 𝑝>0) and
- value 0 otherwise.
